# AI Resume Analyser 📄

An AI-powered tool that compares a resume against a job description and gives:
- Match score out of 10
- Matched and missing skills
- Resume improvement tips
- Likely interview questions
- PDF & CSV export
- Analysis history & caching
- Rate limiting & input validation

Built with **Groq API** + **Streamlit** + **SQLite** — runs fully on your laptop, completely free.

## 🔐 Security First

**Your API key is NEVER stored in code or visible in the dashboard!**
- Stored safely in `.env` file (local only)
- `.env` is in `.gitignore` and never uploaded to GitHub
- Only you have access to your key
- Setup instructions are in this README, not in the app

---

## Setup (5 minutes)

### Step 1 — Get your free Groq API key
1. Go to https://console.groq.com
2. Sign up (free, no credit card required)
3. Navigate to **API Keys** in the left sidebar
4. Click **Create API Key**
5. Copy the key (it will look like: `gsk_...`)

### Step 2 — Create `.env` file
Create a file named `.env` in the project folder with:
```
GROQ_API_KEY=gsk_your_actual_key_here_replace_this
ENABLE_LOGGING=False
LOG_FILE=resume_analyser.log
```

**DO NOT commit this file to GitHub!** It's in `.gitignore` for protection.

### Step 3 — Install dependencies
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Step 4 — Run the app
```bash
streamlit run app.py
```

The app opens in your browser automatically at `http://localhost:8501`

## How to use

1. **App loads automatically** — API key is already loaded from `.env`
2. **On the left**: Paste or upload your **Job Description** (PDF or text)
3. **On the right**: Paste or upload your **Resume** (PDF or text)
4. Click **🔍 Analyse Resume**
5. View your:
   - ✅ Match score (out of 10)
   - ✅ Matched skills (green)
   - ✅ Missing skills (red)
   - ✅ Resume improvement tips
   - ✅ Likely interview questions
6. **Download results** as CSV or PDF

## Sample Interview Answer

*"I built an AI Resume Analyser using Python, Streamlit, and the Groq API. It analyzes how well a resume matches a job description, providing a score, skill gaps, and interview questions. Key features include PDF upload, SQLite database storage, caching, rate limiting, and secure API key management using environment variables. The results can be exported as PDF or CSV. It demonstrates security best practices, database design, error handling, and practical AI integration."*

## Troubleshooting

### "API Key Not Found!"
- Create a `.env` file in the project folder
- Add: `GROQ_API_KEY=gsk_your_key_here`
- Make sure `.env` is in the same folder as `app.py`
- Reload the app

### "Model Decommissioned"
- Select a different model from the dropdown in sidebar
- Current active models:
  - `llama-3.1-8b-instant` ⚡ (Fastest)
  - `llama-3.3-70b-versatile` 🧠 (Most powerful)
  - `openai/gpt-oss-20b` (Balanced)

### "Rate Limit Error"
- Wait 30 seconds before next analysis
- Check Groq console for API usage: https://console.groq.com

### "PDF Not Extracting"
- Ensure PDF is not scanned image (must be text-based PDF)
- Try copying text manually instead
